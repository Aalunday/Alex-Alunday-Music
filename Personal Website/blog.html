  <h1>My Blog</h1>
  <p>One of the biggest lessons I have learned throughout my (few) years of playing and teaching professionally, is the importance of creativity. It is something that our current education system squanders and destroys. As an educator all I hope to do is teach my students how to be free enough to know there is never one way to achieve something. So this blog is my way of putting some of these ideals to words in hopes it can reach and inspire more people and help guide, just as my own mentors have done for me.</p>

    <!-- Rest of your content goes here -->
    <p>I am a big believer that everyone can be creative whether they realize it or not. Creativity is not some divine gift that only few are given. It is also not always something as grand as being able to create the most beautiful melodies, magnificent paintings, or the most intriguing tales. Creativity can be as small as putting together a nice outfit or being able to change your route to work due to an accident. Creativity is the thing that makes us uniquely us and it is critical for every human being to develop and embrace this part of themselves. .</p>
